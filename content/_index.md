## About The Lab
Welcome to the homepage of the MERGe Lab, where we are working on making **M**aterials **E**mbody **R**obots, **Ge**ometrically. We are located at [UT Austin's Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu) department and led by Professor [Lillian Chin](https://lillych.in). We *merge* ideas across disciplines and see what interesting robots *emerge* as a result.

> If you are interested in working with us, please read [**this FAQ page**](https://lillych.in/faq/admissions/) before sending any emails.

We are broadly interested in the following research questions:
1. Design of novel actuators and sensors through geometry
1. Algorithmic frameworks to generate mechanisms for custom mechanical properties
1. Robot manipulation enhanced through accurate force and tactile sensing
1. Participatory design-based robot deployment in real-world communities
