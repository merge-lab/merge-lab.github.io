We are working on how to make materials embody robots geometrically. Our general philosophy is by merging different fields, we will see interesting research emerge as a result





## About Me
Hello! I'm Lilly Chin, an assistant professor at UT Austin's Electrical and Computer Engineering department. For a professional bio, click [**HERE**](/bio). 

> **I am actively looking for graduate students and postdocs for the 2024-2025 school year.** If interested, please apply directly to [UT Austin ECE](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/academics/graduate/admissions), listing my name, and [contact me](https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/) explaining what research interests we share.

My research vision is to build robots' physical bodies in dialogue with human communities by (1) directly designing the geometry of the materials that make up robots and (2) using [design justice](https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu) as a tool to include all voices in the robot design process. Specifically, I'm interested in:
1. Design of novel actuators and sensors through geometry
1. Algorithmic frameworks to generate mechanisms for custom mechanical properties
1. Robot manipulation enhanced through accurate force and tactile sensing
1. Participatory design-based robot deployment in real-world communities

While my website is under construction, [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCogl5084ngbvw_SfUKuLktw) will give you a quick overview of my publications.

This website also provides an archive of my personal projects, ranging from [engineering projects](/projects/making), [visual art](/projects/crafting), and [amateur and professional writing](/projects/writing). I also keep an archive of my higher visibility activities such as my performance on Jeopardy! as the [2017 College Champion / "spiciest memelord"](/press/#jeopardy).
