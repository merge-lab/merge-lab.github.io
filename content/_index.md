## About The Lab
Welcome to the homepage of the MERGe Lab, where we are working on making **M**aterials **E**mbody **R**obots, **Ge**ometrically. We are located at [UT Austin's Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utexas.edu) department and led by Professor [Lillian Chin](https://lillych.in). We *merge* ideas across disciplines and see what interesting robots *emerge* as a result.

<!-- > **We are actively looking for graduate students and postdocs for the 2024-2025 school year.** If interested, please apply directly to [UT Austin ECE](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/academics/graduate/admissions), listing Professor Lillian Chin's name, and [contact her directly](https://litchin.wordpress.com/contact/) explaining what research interests we share. The more specific, the better! -->

We are broadly interested in the following research questions:
1. Design of novel actuators and sensors through geometry
1. Algorithmic frameworks to generate mechanisms for custom mechanical properties
1. Robot manipulation enhanced through accurate force and tactile sensing
1. Participatory design-based robot deployment in real-world communities
