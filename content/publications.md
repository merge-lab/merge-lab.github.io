Machine learning for soft robot proprioception should match the data distribution and sensor inputs
**Machine Learning Best Practices for Soft Robot Proprioception** <br>Annan Zhang*, Tsun-Hsuan Wang*, Ryan L. Truby, <u>Lillian Chin</u>, Daniela Rus<br>*IROS 2023*<br> [Paper](https://www.annanzhang.com/data/pdf/zhang2023machine.pdf)<br><br>Based on experiments on two large soft robotics datasets, we derive best practices for training neural networks that map sensor signals to soft robot shape.

**Vision-Based Sensing for Electrically-Driven Soft Actuators**<br>Annan Zhang, Ryan L. Truby, <u>Lillian Chin</u>, Shuguang Li, Daniela Rus<br>*IEEE RA-L*, 2022. Also presented at IROS 2022.<br> [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9866780) <br><br>We use cameras to record the interior of compliant electric actuators and train a neural network that maps the visual feedback to the actuator's tip pose. Our method presents a robust approach for sensorizing hollow-bodied actuators and provides accurate predictions in the presence of external disturbances.

**Fluidic Innervation Sensorizes Structures from a Single Build Material**<br>Ryan L. Truby*, <u>Lillian Chin*</u>, Annan Zhang, Daniela Rus<br>*Science Advances*, 2022<br>[Paper](https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/sciadv.abq4385) | [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2022/materials-sense-movements-0810) <br><br> We embed air-filled channels within architected materials and measure the pressure change during deformation. Our method integrates programmed mechanical behavior, sensing, and actuation and enables sensorized structures for wearables and robotics from one single build material. <!-- highlight -->
