title: Research
toc: true
preamble: The core focus of MERGe Lab is **building better robots through intentional design of their bodies.** As robots are deployed outside of the lab and the factory, their bodies will need to match the wide variety of human environments. Our current suite of robot materials, structures, actuators and sensors are not adequate for human contact, let alone the wide range of environments that humans live in. <p></p> To address this need, MERGe Lab's key research strategy is to **design a material's geometry for robotic functionality**. Taking cues from developments in [mechanical metamaterials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_metamaterial) / [architected materials](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070115-031624), we recognize that designing a material's geometry has significant downstream effects on the material's mechanical behavior -- and, thus, the robot's end performance. This materials and geometry based approach has successfully created many unique and effective robot designs that are ripe for further computational optimization.

# Active Projects

## Blind Grasping
This has been a longstanding project goal for me to accomplish. The idea is that we have an object inside of a box. I'd like the robot without vision to fumble around inside the box, hitting the walls and eventually finding the object. Then figuring out how to grasp the object in order to take it out.

We can make it harder by adding more objects into the box and asking for a specific object to get pulled out.

## Computational Design with Sensorized Building Blocks
Using fluidic innervation as a technique to make larger structures

The idea behind this is the feeling that working primarily in lattices and their repeated geometry should offer some critical insight to the mathematics and modeling and make them easier to work with. 

## Custom Sensorized Hands for Dexterous Manipulation
I have a lot of ideas for funky hands to help the software manipulation folks do cool stuff. Basically, continuing the spirit of Greg further.
