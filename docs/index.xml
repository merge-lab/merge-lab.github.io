Embedded Air Channels Transform Soft Lattices into Sensorized Grippers
Annan Zhang*, Lillian Chin*, Daniel L. Tong, Daniela Rus
ICRA 2024
Paper in press We create a sensorized parallel jaw gripper by printing cubic lattice fingers with embedded air channels.</description></item><item><title>Research</title><link>/research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/research/</guid><description>Active Projects Blind Grasping Current robots can do impressive grasping tasks with cameras and other forms of computer vision. However, humans are able to accomplish more dexterous manipulations without any vision, such as striking a match, juggling or solving a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube. There is a clear need to build the tactile sensors, end effectors and algorithms to imitate non-visual human manipulation.
In this project, the goal is to have a robot be able to reach inside a box, fumble around, and eventually find an object inside without the use of cameras.</description></item></channel></rss>
