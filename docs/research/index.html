Our current suite of robot materials, structures, actuators and sensors are not adequate for human contact, let alone the wide range of environments that humans live in.<figure class=small-figure><a href=/img/thesisTree.png><img loading=lazy sizes="(min-width: 35em) 467px, 400px, 100vw (max-width: 467)" srcset='/img/thesisTree_hu14739662980900108232.png 200w

Taking cues from developments in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_metamaterial>mechanical metamaterials</a> / <a href=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070115-031624>architected materials</a>, we recognize that designing a material&rsquo;s geometry has significant downstream effects on the material&rsquo;s mechanical behavior &ndash; and, thus, the robot&rsquo;s end performance. This materials and geometry based approach has successfully created many unique and effective robot designs that are ripe for further computational optimization.<p></p><strong>Project List:</strong></p><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#active-projects>Active Projects</a><ul><li><a href=#blind-grasping>Blind Grasping</a></li><li><a href=#computational-design-with-sensorized-building-blocks>Computational Design with Sensorized Building Blocks</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#up-and-coming-projects>Up-and-Coming Projects</a></li><li><a href=#previous-projects>Previous Projects</a><ul><li><a href=#modular-volumetric-actuators-auxbots>Modular Volumetric Actuators (Auxbots)</a></li><li><a href=#handed-shearing-auxetics-hsas>Handed Shearing Auxetics (HSAs)</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav><center><hr width=90%></center><h1 id=active-projects>Active Projects</h1><figure class=small-figure><a href=/img/icra2024.png><img loading=lazy sizes="(min-width: 35em) 816px, 400px, 100vw (max-width: 816)" srcset='/img/icra2024_hu17133644015538569759.png 200w

However, humans are able to accomplish more dexterous manipulations without any vision, such as striking a match, juggling or solving a Rubik&rsquo;s cube. There is a clear need to build the tactile sensors, end effectors and algorithms to imitate non-visual human manipulation.</p><p>In this project, the goal is to have a robot be able to reach inside a box, fumble around, and eventually find an object inside without the use of cameras. This is a contact-rich task that will require identifying the box walls, searching for an unknown object and executing the optimal grasp to take it out of the box. With our past work in <a href=https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abq4385>fluidic innervation</a> and <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8794098>object sensing</a>, we are confident not only in our ability to achieve this task, but also potentially solve grasping a specific object in clutter.</p><figure class=small-figure><a href=/img/rhinoHSA.png><img loading=lazy sizes="(min-width: 35em) 839px, 400px, 100vw (max-width: 839)" srcset='/img/rhinoHSA_hu6732236784475917261.png 200w

We will then build up to more complex lattice structures, such as <a href=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/116908>handed shearing auxetics</a> before moving to more stochastic structures like Voronoi foams.</p><center><hr width=90%></center><h1 id=up-and-coming-projects>Up-and-Coming Projects</h1><p>Beyond our core research focus of building robotic sensors and actuators, we are also interested in:</p><ol><li>exploring the potential for new geometric designs</li><li>creating sensors and strategies that can enable contact-rich manipulation</li><li>applying these robotic devices for human-centered applications like co-design of accessibility technologies</li></ol><p>Some potential projects in these directions include::</p><ul><li><strong>Custom Sensorized Hands for Dexterous Manipulation:</strong> Let&rsquo;s continue to explore the design space of neat end effectors to really leverage the current advances in manipulation planning</li><li><strong>Design of Foldable Mechanisms:</strong> We will draw on ideas from origami, rigidity theory and mechanical metamaterials to explore new geometries for robotic applications</li><li><strong>Tactile / Force Sensors for Medical Applications:</strong> We are particularly interested in creating sensorized phantoms to provide feedback to clinicians, caregivers and patients.</li><li><strong>Disability Justice for Design of Robot Bodies:</strong> We are interested in furthering the principles of <a href=https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu>design justice</a> by more directly involving end-users in the initial design of robotics.

Unlike, say, a rubber band, which gets skinnier as you stretch it, auxetic materials get thicker as you stretch them due to their internal geometry. In this project, we applied actuation directly to a <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8968187>spherical auxetic shell</a> to create modular robots with motor-driven volume expansion (Auxbots). By controlling the shell&rsquo;s geometry, we could create robots optimized for speed and expansion ratio (390% volume expansion in 0.2 seconds) or for <a href=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9976216>force output</a> (135 N max, or <strong>76x strength-weight ratio</strong>, one of the highest ratios of any modular robot). We could explicitly make trade-offs between stiffness, speed, and force as a direct consequence of how the geometric parameters affect the overall system behavior.</p><p>We then connected multiple auxbots together for more complex actuation, similar to how biological cells come together to form tissues and organs. With the speed and size optimized auxbots, we created a 2x2x2 cube that could move forward, turn, and flip, due to the high impulse response. Meanwhile, with the force optimized auxbots, we created a flipper-like locomotion by tying adjacent auxbots together with a wire. This simultaneous lifting and bending action led to a seven-bot quadruped that could <strong>carry loads up to 1.5x its total weight (2 kg), even with some auxbots stalling out</strong>. Auxbots thus demonstrate not only how geometry gives greater control of robot performance but also offers a potential pathway to address the gap between simulation and reality.</p><figure class=small-figure><a href=/img/hsa.png><img loading=lazy sizes="(min-width: 35em) 822px, 400px, 100vw (max-width: 822)" srcset='/img/hsa_hu7427223168678040156.png 200w

After that point, further expansion leads to a collapse down to their mirror image. By contrast, we discovered a materials called handed shearing auxetics (HSAs) that have a chirality. Thus, if a left-handed and a right-handed HSA are rotated against one another, they will fight against the other&rsquo;s rotation and &ldquo;lock-in&rdquo; their position.</p><p>This approach enabled us to create several soft robots just by changing the geometric structure. We created a 4 degree-of-freedom robotic platform directly from HSAs by placing opposite handed HSAs in a 2x2 grid and attaching a motor to each HSA. Similar high degree-of-freedom platforms would require significantly more infrastructure, like the six prismatic joints needed for a Stewart platform. Likewise, we created robotic fingers from the HSAs by drawing a line through the pattern. This line would act as a strain-limiting layer, forcing the entire structure to bend inwards. Since the <a href=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/116908>HSA gripper</a> is motor-driven, it is <strong>2x faster at opening and closing, 20x more power efficient</strong>, and occupies a smaller footprint than standard soft pneumatic-based grippers, all while maintaining a similar grasping performance.</p><nav class=footer><hr><p class=text-muted style=float:left;text-align:left><small>Last updated: Oct 31, 2024</small></p><p class=text-muted style=float:right;text-align:right><small><img loading=lazy src=/icons8-mail-24.png alt="Email Icon" style=vertical-align:middle><span id=obfuscate>merge-labatutlistsdotutexasdotedu</span></small></p></nav><script>unobfuscate("obfuscate","<n uers='znvygb:zretr-yno@hgyvfgf.hgrknf.rqh'>zretr-yno@hgyvfgf.hgrknf.rqh</n>")</script></body></html>
